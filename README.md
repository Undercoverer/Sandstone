## This project will be a website, accessible by production managers, in order for them to get detailed information of the supply and demand of their stock. This includes the current data for each item, to help determine pricing and stock, as well as it's trends. For instance, you may want to see what your most demanded items are, this site would tell you that as well as if it's gone up or down recently, now you can more easily determine if you should increase/decrease your price, as well as if you should ramp up production or not. You will also be able to import data via JSON, to more efficiently add tags for product names, IDs, stock, cost, and images to your database of products.
